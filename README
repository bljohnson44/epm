README - ESP Package Manager (EPM) 2.6
--------------------------------------

WHAT IS EPM?

    EPM is the software packaging tool that we now use at Easy Software
    Products.  It is a simple tool that generates software and patch
    distributions in various formats, including:

	- AT&T Software Packages ("pkg"), used by Solaris.
	- Compaq Tru64 UNIX ("setld")
	- Debian Package Manager ("dpkg")
	- HP-UX Software Packages ("swinstall" or "depot")
	- IRIX Software Manager ("inst" or "tardist")
	- Portable (installation and removal scripts with tar files)
        - Red Hat Package Manager ("RPM")

    EPM also includes a graphical "setup" program that can be provided
    with your distributions to make installation of more than one
    package a snap.


WHY ANOTHER SOFTWARE PACKAGING TOOL?

    We developed EPM because we are tired of developing and testing N
    different software distributions, each with their own input files
    and setup requirements.
    
    Also, when we started looking at selling software for Linux we saw
    that there are at least four different "standard" distribution
    formats, and none of them are compatible with the other.  Clearly
    we needed something that could be used for all platforms, *without*
    requiring special software packages on the customer's system!


HOW DO I COMPILE EPM?

    See the file "INSTALL" for more info on that.


HOW DO I USE EPM?

    Please look at the EPM man page; a preformatted copy is included in
    the file "epm.1":

        more epm.1

    An example EPM software list file is provided with this distribution
    in the file "epm.list".

    There are also several HTML files that should prove useful:

        epm.html       - The EPM man page in HTML format.
	epm-paper.html - "Software Packaging with the ESP Package Manager".
	epm-cups.html  - An annotated EPM list file for CUPS.


DO I HAVE TO PAY TO DISTRIBUTE SOFTWARE USING EPM?

    No!  EPM is free software and any installations you create are
    unencumbered by licensing of any kind (not even the GPL.)


WHAT'S NEW IN EPM?

    See the file "CHANGES" for change information.
