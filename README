README - ESP Package Manager (EPM) 1.0
--------------------------------------

WHAT IS EPM?

    EPM is the software packaging tool that we now use at Easy Software
    Products.  It is a simple tool that generates compressed tar files
    containing installation and removal scripts, a README and license
    file, and a tar file containing the actual software files.  EPM can
    also generate patch distributions and keeps track of software that
    is installed using the EPM-generated scripts.


WHY ANOTHER SOFTWARE PACKAGING TOOL?

    We developed EPM because we are sick of developing and testing N
    different software distributions for the operating systems we
    support.  Also, when we started looking at selling software for
    Linux we saw that there are at least four different "standard"
    distribution formats, and none of them are compatible with the
    other.  Also, many of these formats required that you install the
    software on your development system (or performing some voodoo
    magic) before you could build your distribution!

    Clearly we needed something that could be used for all platforms,
    *without* requiring special software packages on the customer's
    system!


WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR EPM?

    On your development system you just need a C compiler, a make
    program, the Bourne (or Korn or Bash) shell, a tar program, and
    GNU zip.

    On the destination system your customers/users will need the Bourne
    (or Korn or Bash) shell, a tar program, and GNU zip. The first two
    are standard items, and GNU zip is being shipped by most vendors as
    well.


HOW DO I COMPILE EPM?

    EPM uses GNU autoconf to configure itself for your system.  To build
    it, use:

        ./configure ENTER
	make ENTER

    Once EPM is compiled you can type:

        su ENTER
	make install ENTER

    to install the software in /usr/bin.


HOW DO I USE EPM?

    Please look at the EPM man page; a preformatted copy is included in
    the file "epm.1":
