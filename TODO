TODO for EPM:

	- Add /opt relocation hack (and maybe allow for
	  relocatable packages in general?)
	- Add support for executables and libraries created with
	  libtool.
	- Add a small script that can be installed with every
	  portable software package to list and remove installed
	  packages.
	- Add better manpage installation support - specifically,
	  add code to automatically locate the correct man directory
	  for each file depending on the architecture.
	- Add support for dependency checking against vendor
	  packages; that is, a portable package could check its
	  dependencies against portable, RPM, Debian, etc.
	  packages, rather than just packages of the same format.
	- Support filenames with spaces.
	- Support run levels for init scripts.
