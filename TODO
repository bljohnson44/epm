TODO for EPM:

	- Add /opt relocation hack and allow for relocatable and
	  non-root packages in general.
	- Add support for executables and libraries created with
	  libtool.
	- Add better manpage installation support -
	  specifically, add code to automatically locate the
	  correct man directory for each file depending on the
	  architecture.
	- Add support for dependency checking against vendor
	  packages; that is, a portable package could check its
	  dependencies against portable, RPM, Debian, etc.
	  packages, rather than just packages of the same
	  format.
	- Add support for checksums (probably just "sum"
	  command) to verify the tar files and installed files.
