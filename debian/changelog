epm (4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Homepage and Vcs-* fields to debian/control.
  * Update Standards-Version.

epm (4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Revert configure.in change, which used to be necessary for Debian to
    select the proper autoconf version.  Instead, now just
    Build-Conflict with autoconf2.13 (where the version-selection code
    now resides).
  * Remove the EPM-built native and portable packages built by "make
    test".
  * Fix documentation to include what we need, and only what we need.

epm (4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Update Standards-Version.
  * Build the docs instead of relying on the tarball versions;
    we now have to do that anyway for the man pages.
  * Run the test suite as a mandatory part of the build.
  * Add image libraries to Build-Depends, since newer FLTK can
    use image libraries, and our config asks for that.
  * Add needed X libs to Build-Depends, since they don't all
    magically come in with libfltk1.1-dev anymore.

epm (3.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Turn off .SILENT during the build, so build problems in build
    logs aren't hidden.
  * Don't always link against FLTK statically; this caused FTBFS
    problems when unrelated static libs aren't available.
    Closes: #357758, #359981.
  * Build-Depend on rpm, so the configure script can probe it.
    Closes: #337179, #321370.

  * Updated Build-Depends to require libfltk1.1-dev.
  * Upped to debhelper compatibility level 4.
  * Added AC_PREREQ to configure.in so Debian's autoconf would do
    the right thing.
  * Updated to current Policy.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Mar 2003 22:37:24 -0500

epm (3.0-4) unstable; urgency=low
