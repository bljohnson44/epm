<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>mkepmlist</STRONG>  [ -g <EM>group</EM> ] [ -u <EM>user</EM> ] [ --prefix <EM>directory</EM> ]
       <EM>directory</EM> [ ...  <EM>directory</EM> ]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>mkepmlist</STRONG> recursively  generates  file  list  entries  for
       files,  links,  and  directories. The file list is send to
       the standard output.

       The <EM>-g</EM> option overrides the group ownership of  the  files
       in  the  specified  directories  with  the specified group
       name.

       The <EM>-u</EM> option overrides the user ownership of the files in
       the specified directories with the specified user name.

       The  <EM>--prefix</EM>  option  adds the specified directory to the
       destination path. For example, if you installed  files  to
       /opt/foo and wanted to build a distribution that installed
       the files in /usr/local, the following command would  gen-
       erate a file list that is installed in /usr/local:

            mkepmlist --prefix=/usr/local /opt/foo &gt;foo.list
