       eeppmm  generates  software  packages complete with installa-
       tion, removal, and (if necessary)  patch  scripts.  Unless
       otherwise  specified,  the  files required for _p_r_o_d_u_c_t are
       read from a file named "_p_r_o_d_u_c_t.list".

       The _-_a option ("architecture") specifies the actual archi-
       tecture  for the software. Without this option the generic
       processor architecture is used ("intel", "sparc",  "mips",
       etc.)

       The  _-_f  option ("format") specifies the distribution for-
       mat:

       aix
            Generate an AIX distribution suitable  for  installa-
            tion on an AIX system.

       bsd
            Generate a BSD distribution suitable for installation
            on a FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD system.

       deb
            Generate a Debian distribution suitable for installa-
            tion on a Debian Linux system.

       inst, tardist
            Generate  an IRIX distribution suitable for installa-
            tion on an system running IRIX.

       native
            Generate an native distribution. This  uses  _r_p_m  for
            Linux,  _i_n_s_t for IRIX, _p_k_g for Solaris, _s_w_i_n_s_t_a_l_l for
            HP-UX, and _b_s_d for FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.  All
            other  operating systems default to the _p_o_r_t_a_b_l_e for-
            mat.

       pkg
            Generate an AT&T software  package.  These  are  used
            primarily under Solaris.

       portable
            Generate  a  portable  distribution  based  on  shell
            scripts and tar files.  The resulting distribution is

            installed  and  removed the same way on all operating
            systems. [default]

       rpm
            Generate a Red Hat Package Manager ("RPM")  distribu-
            tion  suitable  for  installation  on a Red Hat Linux
            system.

       setld
            Generate a Tru64 (setld) software distribution.

       swinstall, depot
            Generate a HP-UX software distribution.

       Executable files in the distribution are normally stripped
       of  debugging  information  when packaged. To disable this
       functionality use the _-_g option.

       Intermediate (spec, etc.) files used to create the distri-
       bution are normally removed after the distribution is cre-
       ated. The _-_k option keeps these files in the  distribution
       directory.

       The _-_s and _-_-_s_e_t_u_p_-_i_m_a_g_e options ("setup") include the ESP
       Software Wizard with the specified XPM image file with the
       distribution.  This  option is currently only supported by
       portable distributions.

       The _-_-_s_e_t_u_p_-_p_r_o_g_r_a_m option specifies the setup  executable
       to  use  with  the  distribution. This option is currently
       only supported by portable distributions.

       The _-_-_s_e_t_u_p_-_t_y_p_e_s option specifies the _s_e_t_u_p_._t_y_p_e_s file to
       include  with  the  distribution. This option is currently
       only supported by portable distributions.

       The _-_v option ("verbose") increases the amount of informa-
       tion  that  is reported. Use multiple v's for more verbose
       output.

       Distributions normally are named  "product-version-system-
       release-machine.ext"  and "product-version-system-release-
       machine-patch.ext" (for patch distributions.) The "system-
       release-machine"  information  can be customized or elimi-
       nated using the _-_n option with  the  appropriate  trailing
       letters.  Using  _-_n  by  itself  will  remove the "system-
       release-machine" string from the filename entirely.

       Debian, IRIX, portable, and Red Hat distributions use  the
       extensions   ".deb",   ".tardist",  "tar.gz",  and  ".rpm"
       respectively.

       The  _R_P_M_D_I_R  environment  variable will override where EPM
       looks for RPM  distributions  you  generate.  The  default
       locations   are  /usr/src/redhat/RPMS,  /usr/src/RPM/RPMS,
       /usr/src/packages/RPMS, and /usr/local/src/RPMS.
