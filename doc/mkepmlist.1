       mmkkeeppmmlliisstt recursively  generates  file  list  entries  for
       files,  links,  and  directories. The file list is send to
       the standard output.

       The _-_g option overrides the group ownership of  the  files
       in  the  specified  directories  with  the specified group
       name.

       The _-_u option overrides the user ownership of the files in
       the specified directories with the specified user name.

       The  _-_-_p_r_e_f_i_x  option  adds the specified directory to the
       destination path. For example, if you installed  files  to
       "/opt/foo"   and  wanted  to  build  a  distribution  that
       installed the files in "/usr/local", the following command
       would   generate   a   file  list  that  is  installed  in
       "/usr/local":

            mkepmlist --prefix=/usr/local /opt/foo >foo.list
