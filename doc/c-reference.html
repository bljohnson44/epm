<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT"><A NAME="REFERENCE">C - List File Reference</A></H1>

<P>This appendix provides a complete reference for the EPM list file
and setup types formats.</P>

<H2>The EPM List File Format</H2>

<P>Each <I>EPM</I> product has an associated list file that
describes the files to include with the product. Comment lines
begin with the "#" character and are ignored. All other
non-blank lines must begin with a letter, dollar sign ("$"), or
the percent sign ("%").</P>

supported by <I>EPM</I>:</P>

</DL></UL>

<H3>List Variables</H3>

<P><I>EPM</I> maintains a list of variables and their values
which can be used to substitute values in the list file. These
variables are imported from the current environment and taken
from the command-line and list file as provided. Substitutions
occur when the variable name is referenced with the dollar sign
($):</P>

<UL><PRE>
%postinstall &lt;&lt;EOF
echo What is your name:
read $$name
echo Your name is $$name
EOF

f 0555 root sys ${bindir}/foo foo
f 0555 root sys $datadir/foo/foo.dat foo.dat
</PRE></UL>

<P>Variable names can be surrounded by curley brackets (${name})
or alone ($name); without brackets the name is terminated by the
first slash (/), dash (-), or whitespace. The dollar sign can be
inserted using $$.</P>

<H2><A NAME="SETUPTYPES">The setup.types File</A></H2>

<P>The EPM <B>setup</B> program normally presents the user with
a list of software products to install, which is called a
"custom" software installation.</P>

<P>If a file called <I>setup.types</I> is present in the package
directory, the user will instead be presented with a list of
instal- lation types. Each type has an associated product list
which determines the products that are installed by default. If
a type has no products associated with it, then it is treated as
a custom installation and the user is presented with a list of
packages to choose from.</P>

<P>The <I>setup.types</I> file is an ASCII text file consisting
of type and product lines. Comments can be inserted by starting
a line with the pound sign (#). Each installation type is
defined by a line starting with the word <CODE>TYPE</CODE>.
Products are defined by a line starting with the word
<CODE>INSTALL</CODE>:</P>

<UL><PRE>
TYPE Typical End-User Configuration
INSTALL foo
INSTALL foo-help
TYPE Typical Developer Configuration
INSTALL foo
INSTALL foo-help
INSTALL foo-devel
INSTALL foo-examples
TYPE Custom Configuration
</PRE></UL>

<P>In the example above, three installation types are defined.
Since the last type includes no products, the user will be
presented with the full list of products to choose from.</P>
