<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT"><A NAME="INTRO">1 - Introduction to EPM</A></H1>

<P>This chapter provides an introduction to the ESP Package Manager ("EPM").

<H2>What is EPM?</H2>

<P>Software distribution under UNIX/Linux can be a challenge,
especially if you ship software for more than one operating
system. Every operating system provides its own software
packaging tools and each has unique requirements or implications
for the software development environment.</P>

<P>The ESP Package Manager ("EPM") is one solution to this
problem. Besides its own "portable" distribution format, EPM
also supports the generation of several vendor-specific formats.
This allows you to build software distribution files for almost
any UNIX/Linux operating system from the same sources.</P>

<H2>History and Evolution</H2>

<P>When Easy Software Products was founded in 1993, we
originally shipped software only for the SGI IRIX operating
system. In 1997 we added support for Solaris, which was quickly
followed by HP-UX support in 1998.</P>

<P>Each new operating system and supported processor required a
new set of packaging files. While this worked, it also meant
that we had to keep all of the packaging files synchronized
manually. Needless to say, this process was far from perfect and
we had more than one distribution that was not identical on all
operating systems.</P>

<P>As we began developing the
<A HREF="http://www.cups.org">Common UNIX Printing System
("CUPS")</A> in 1998, our goal was to add support for two
additional operating systems: Linux and Compaq Tru64 UNIX. If we
wanted to avoid the mistakes of the past, we clearly had to
change how we produced software distributions.</P>

<P>The first version of EPM was released in 1999 and supported
so-called "portable" software distributions that were not tied
to any particular operating system or packaging software. Due to
popular demand, we added support for vendor-specific packaging
formats in the second major release of EPM, allowing the
generation of portable or "native" distributions from one
program and one set of software distribution files.

<H2>Existing Software Packaging Systems</H2>

<P>As we looked for a solution to our problem, we naturally
investigated the existing open-source packaging systems. Under
Linux, we looked at the RedHat Package Manager ("RPM") and
Debian packaging software ("dpkg" and "dselect"). For the
commercial UNIX's we looked at the vendor-supplied packaging
systems. Table 1.1 shows the results of our investigation.</P>

<OL>

	<LI>Standard packaging system for named operating systems.</LI>

	<LI>These packaging systems are cross-platform but require
	the package management utilities to be installed on the
	platform before installing the package.</LI>

</OL>

<P>As you can see, none of the formats supported every feature
we were looking for. One common fault of all these formats is
that they do not support a common software specification file
format. That is, making a Debian software distribution requires
significantly different support files than required for a
Solaris pkg distribution. This makes it extremely difficult to
manage distributions for multiple operating systems.</P>

<P>All of the package formats support binary distributions. The
RPM and Debian formats also support source distributions that
specifically allow for recompilation and installation. Only the
commercial UNIX formats support patch distributions - you have
to completely upgrade a software package with RPM and Debian.
All but the Solaris pkg format allow you to upgrade a package
without removing the old version first.</P>

<P>When building the software packages, RPM and Debian force you
to create the actual directories, copy the files to those
directories, and set the ownerships and permissions. You
essentially are creating a directory for your software that can
be archived in the corresponding package format. To ensure that
all file permissions and ownerships are correct, you must build
the distribution as the root user, introducing potential
security risks and violating many corporate security policies.
It can also make building distributions difficult when dynamic
data such as changing data files or databases is involved.</P>

<P>The commercial UNIX formats use software list files that map
source files to the correct directories and permissions.
This allows for easier delivery of dynamic data, configuration
management of what each distribution actually contains, and
eliminates security issues with special permissions and building
distributions as the root user. Using the proprietary format
also has the added benefit of allowing for software patches and
using the familiar software installation tools for that
operating system. The primary disadvantage is that the same
distributions and packaging software cannot be used on other
operating systems.</P>

<H2>Design Goals of EPM</H2>

<P>Our goals for the first release of EPM were fairly simple:</P>

<OL>

	<LI>Build binary software distributions using a common
	software specification format. The same distribution
	files must work for all operating systems.</LI>

	<LI>Optionally strip executable files before packaging.</LI>

	<LI>Map source files and directories to the installation
	locations and permissions.</LI>

	<LI>Support configuration files and boot-time
	initialization scripts.</LI>

	<LI>Automatically backup existing files when a product
	replaces an existing file.</LI>

	<LI>Provide installation and removal scripts that will
	work on all systems without additional software.</LI>

	<LI>Support automatic upgrades to newer versions of a
	product using full or (smaller) patch distributions.</LI>

	<LI>Support software package conflicts, requirements,
	and replacements.</LI>

	<LI>Support network installations where
	<CODE>/usr</CODE> is shared amongst client machines.</LI>

	<LI>Make it all open-source under the GNU GPL.</LI>

</OL>

<P>As we approached EPM 2.x we added the following goals:</P>

<OL>

	<LI>Support portable and vendor package formats from the
	same specification files. Make the interface easily
	extended to support new formats as they are implemented.</LI>

	<LI>Provide a simple GUI installer that can be included
	with portable distributions, like the popular
	InstallShield software in the Microsoft Windows world.</LI>

	<LI>Support variable substitution in filenames to allow
	for easier relocation and/or naming of files in the
	distribution.</LI>

	<LI>Support wildcards in source filenames.</LI>

</OL>

<P>The EPM 3.x versions add still more goals:

<OL>

	<LI>Provide better documentation, like this manual.</LI>

	<LI>Add support for executables and libraries created with
	libtool.</LI>

	<LI>Add an <CODE>install(8)</CODE> replacement command that
	can be used to create list files.</LI>

	<LI>Add a small script that can be installed with every
	portable software package to list and remove installed
	packages.</LI>

	<LI>Add support for more vendor-specific formats; specifically
	AIX and BSD packaging formats.</LI>

	<LI>Add support for relocatable packages.</LI>

	<LI>Add support for Tru64-style "linked" packages, where
	symlinks are created that point to the corresponding files
	and directories in the relocated path.</LI>

	<LI>Add better manpage installation support - specifically,
	add code to automatically locate the correct man directory
	for each file depending on the architecture.</LI>

	<LI>Add support for dependency checking against vendor
	packages; that is, a portable package could check its
	dependencies against portable, RPM, Debian, etc.
	packages, rather than just packages of the same format.</LI>
	
</OL>

<P>As you can see, the focus has been on making the binary
software distribution process as easy as possible. Supporting
source code distributions was not a goal since most RPM and
Debian source distributions are little more than wrapping around
a compressed tar file containing the source files and a
configure script.</P>
