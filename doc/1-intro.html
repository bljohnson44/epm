<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT"><A NAME="INTRO">1 - Introduction to EPM</A></H1>

<P>This chapter provides an introduction to the ESP Package Manager ("EPM").

<H2>What is EPM?</H2>

<P>Software distribution under UNIX/Linux can be a challenge,
especially if you ship software for more than one operating
system. Every operating system provides its own software
packaging tools and each has unique requirements or implications
for the software development environment.</P>

<P>The ESP Package Manager ("EPM") is one solution to this
problem. Besides its own "portable" distribution format, EPM
also supports the generation of several vendor-specific formats.
This allows you to build software distribution files for almost
any UNIX/Linux operating system from the same sources.</P>

<H2>History and Evolution</H2>

<P>When Easy Software Products was founded in 1993, we
originally shipped software only for the SGI IRIX operating
system. In 1997 we added support for Solaris, which was quickly
followed by HP-UX support in 1998.</P>

<P>Each new operating system and supported processor required a
new set of packaging files. While this worked, it also meant
that we had to keep all of the packaging files synchronized
manually. Needless to say, this process was far from perfect and
we had more than one distribution that was not identical on all
operating systems.</P>

<P>As we began developing the Common UNIX Printing System
(<A HREF="http://www.cups.org/">http://www.cups.org/</A>) in
1998, our initial goal was to add support for two additional
operating systems: Linux and Compaq Tru64 UNIX. If we wanted to
avoid the mistakes of the past, we clearly had to change how we
produced software distributions.</P>

<P>The first version of EPM was released in 1999 and supported
so-called "portable" software distributions that were not tied
to any particular operating system or packaging software. Due to
popular demand, we added support for vendor-specific packaging
formats in the second major release of EPM, allowing the
generation of portable or "native" distributions from one
program and one set of software distribution files.

<H2>Existing Software Packaging Systems</H2>

<P>As we looked for a solution to our problem, we naturally
investigated the existing open-source packaging systems. Under
Linux, we looked at the RedHat Package Manager ("RPM") and
Debian packaging software ("dpkg" and "dselect"). For the
commercial UNIX's we looked at the vendor-supplied packaging
systems. Table 1.1 shows the results of our investigation.</P>

<OL>

	<LI>Standard packaging system for named operating systems.</LI>

	<LI>These packaging systems are cross-platform but require
	the package management utilities to be installed on the
	platform before installing the package.</LI>

</OL>

<P>As you can see, none of the formats supported every feature
we were looking for. One common fault of all these formats is
that they do not support a common software specification file
format. That is, making a Debian software distribution requires
significantly different support files than required for a
Solaris pkg distribution. This makes it extremely difficult to
manage distributions for multiple operating systems.</P>

<P>All of the package formats support binary distributions. The
RPM and Debian formats also support source distributions that
specifically allow for recompilation and installation. Only the
commercial UNIX formats support patch distributions - you have
to completely upgrade a software package with RPM and Debian.
All but the Solaris <CODE>pkg</CODE> format allow you to upgrade
a package without removing the old version first.</P>

<P>When building the software packages, RPM and Debian force you
to create the actual directories, copy the files to those
directories, and set the ownerships and permissions. You
essentially are creating a directory for your software that can
be archived in the corresponding package format. To ensure that
all file permissions and ownerships are correct, you must build
the distribution as the root user or use the
<CODE>fakeroot</CODE> software, introducing potential security
risks and violating many corporate security policies. It can
also make building distributions difficult when dynamic data
such as changing data files or databases is involved.</P>

<P>The commercial UNIX formats use software list files that map
source files to the correct directories and permissions.
This allows for easier delivery of dynamic data, configuration
management of what each distribution actually contains, and
eliminates security issues with special permissions and building
distributions as the root user. Using the proprietary format
also has the added benefit of allowing for software patches and
using the familiar software installation tools for that
operating system. The primary disadvantage is that the same
distributions and packaging software cannot be used on other
operating systems.</P>

<H2>Design Goals of EPM</H2>

<P>EPM was designed from the beginning to build binary software
distributions using a common software specification format. The
same distribution files work for all operating systems and all
distribution formats. Supporting source code distributions was
not a goal since most RPM and Debian source distributions are
little more than wrapping around a compressed tar file
containing the source files and a configure script.</P>

<P>Over the years, additional features have made their way into
EPM to support more advanced software packages. Whenever
possible, EPM emulates a feature if the vendor packager does
not support it natively.</P>

<P>The EPM source code can be downloaded in compressed tar files or
via the popular CVS software. Please see the EPM web site for
complete instructions.</P>

<P>The Easy Software Products news server provides several newsgroups
for EPM. You can access it at:</P>

<P>Commercial support for EPM is available from Easy Software Products
and is one way to contribute to the continued development of EPM.
The other way to contribute is by donating code, examples, and
bug fixes. If you have adapted EPM for another operating system
or have added a new feature that you feel will be generally useful,
please contribute it!</P>
