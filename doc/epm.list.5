            _m_o_d_e field is only  used  to  determine  if  a  check
            should be made for a previous version of the file.

LLIISSTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       _E_P_M  maintains  a list of variables and their values which
       can be used to substitute values in the list  file.  These
       variables  are  imported  from the current environment and
       taken from the command-line and  list  file  as  provided.
       Substitutions  occur  when the variable name is referenced
       with the dollar sign ($):

           %install echo What is your name:
           %install read $$name
           %install echo Your name is $$name

           f 0555 root sys ${bindir}/foo foo
           f 0555 root sys $datadir/foo/foo.dat foo.dat

       Variable  names  can  be  surrounded  by  curley  brackets
       (${name})  or  alone ($name); without brackets the name is
       terminated by the first slash (/), dash  (-),  or  whites-
       pace. The dollar sign can be inserted using $$.
