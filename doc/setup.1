       sseettuupp provides a graphical installation interface for EPM-
       generated  portable  installation  packages. It presents a
       step-by-step dialog for collecting a list of  packages  to
       install  and  accepting  any  license agreements for those
       packages.

       sseettuupp searches for products in the  current  directory  or
       the directory specified on the command-line.

       The  default  type  of  installation is "custom". That is,
       users will be able to select from the list of products and
       install them.

       sseettuupp  also  supports  other  types  of installations. The
       _s_e_t_u_p_._t_y_p_e_s file, if present, defines the other  installa-
       tion types.
