<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT"><A NAME="PACKAGING">Packaging Your Software with EPM</A></H1>

<P>This chapter describes how to use EPM to package your own software
packages.</P>

<H2>The Basics</H2>

<P>EPM reads one or more software "list" files that describe a
single software package. Each list file contains one or more
lines of ASCII text containing product or file information.
Comments start with the <CODE>#</CODE> character.

<P>The source field can also use shell wildcards to include
multiple files on a single line:

<UL><PRE>
f 0444 root sys /usr/share/doc/epm *.html
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Creating a List File</H2>

<P><B>EPM 2.6 adds a new <CODE>mkepmlist</CODE> utility that
recursively scans directories and generates the corresponding
list file entries.</B>

<H3>Product Information</H3>

<P>The following is an excerpt from the EPM software list file
(<CODE>epm.list</CODE>) provided with the software:

<UL><PRE>
# Product information
%product ESP Package Manager
%copyright 1999-2001 by Easy Software Products, All Rights Reserved.
%vendor Easy Software Products
%license COPYING
%readme README
%description Universal software packaging tool for UNIX.
%version 2.2
%release 0
</PRE></UL>

<P>As you can see, product information lines (as well as other
EPM directives) start with the percent (<CODE>%</CODE>)
character. The attribute name is followed by the value separated
by whitespace. 

<H2>Adding Files, Directories, and Symlinks</H2>

<H3>Files</H3>

<P>Following the product information is the list of files to be
included in the distribution:

<UL><PRE>
# Executables
%system all
f 0555 root sys /usr/bin/epm epm
f 0555 root sys /usr/lib/epm/setup setup
f 0444 root sys /usr/share/doc/epm/README README
f 0444 root sys /usr/share/doc/epm/COPYING COPYING
f 0444 root sys /usr/share/doc/epm *.html

# Man pages
%system irix
f 0444 root sys /usr/share/catman/u_man/cat1/epm.1 epm.1
%system !irix
f 0444 root sys /usr/man/man1/epm.1 epm.man
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <CODE>%system</CODE> directive is one of two conditional
statements that can be included in software list files. In this
case we are installing the man pages in one of two directories
depending on the operating system.

<P>Plain files are indicated by the <CODE>f</CODE> at the
beginning of each line. Directories, configuration files,
initialization scripts, and symbolic links are specified using
the letters <CODE>d</CODE>, <CODE>c</CODE>, <CODE>i</CODE>, and
<CODE>l</CODE>, respectively. Files that should be included in a
patch upgrade use uppercase letters instead of lowercase.

<P>The remaining data fields on the line are the file permission
bits, the owner, the group, the destination filename, and the
source filename. The source and destination filenames can
contain references to environment variables and variables passed
on the EPM command-line. For example, the man page files can
reference the <CODE>mandir</CODE> variable to relocate the
installed man pages instead of using the <CODE>%system</CODE>
conditional directive:

<UL><PRE>
# Man pages
f 0444 root sys $mandir/cat1/epm.1 epm.1
f 0444 root sys $mandir/man1/epm.1 epm.man
</PRE></UL>

<P>As you can see, variables are referenced using the dollar
sign (<CODE>$</CODE>). As with most shells, variable names can
be surrounded by curly braces (<CODE>${variable}</CODE>) to
explicitly delimit the name.

<P>The source field can also use shell wildcards to include
multiple files on a single line:

<UL><PRE>
f 0444 root sys /usr/share/doc/epm *.html
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Configuration Files</H3>

<P>Configuration files use the same format as regular files; if
the configuration file exists when the software is installed,
then the new configuration file is stored as
<CODE>filename.N</CODE> so it can be merged with the old
configuration file manually. This is one of the configuration
files supplied with the CUPS distribution:

<UL><PRE>
c 0644 root sys /etc/cups/cupsd.conf conf/cupsd.conf
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Directories</H3>

<P>Directories use a source file of <CODE>-</CODE>:

<UL><PRE>
d 0755 root sys /foo/bar/dir -
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Intialization Scripts</H3>

<P>Initialization scripts are scripts or programs that are run
at boot time, usually to start daemon programs. EPM
automatically determines the location of initialization files at
install time, so it can handle the different locations used by
various Linux distributions. This is the initialization script
used by CUPS:

<UL><PRE>
i 0555 root sys cups cups.sh
</PRE></UL>

<P>This specifies that the root name of the initialization
script is <CODE>cups</CODE>, and the file <CODE>cups.sh</CODE>
should be used as the source for the script. EPM creates links
for startup and shutdown at run levels 0, 2, 3, and 5 as
appropriate.

<H3>Symbolic Links</H3>

<P>Symbolic links use the source field as the link value. That
is, if you want to provide a symbolic link from
<CODE>gzip</CODE> to <CODE>gunzip</CODE> in
<CODE>/usr/bin</CODE> you'd use:

<UL><PRE>
l 0555 root sys /usr/bin/gunzip gzip
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Creating the Software Package</H2>

<P>To build a distribution called "epm" from this list file,
simply run:

<UL><PRE>
epm epm
</PRE></UL>

<P>EPM will automatically load the file <CODE>epm.list</CODE> for
the list file; to specify the file directly, use:

<UL><PRE>
epm epm epm.list
</PRE></UL>

<P>The first argument is the name of the package, while the
second is the list filename. The result will be a gzip'd tar
file containing the distribution files and installation script
needed to install the software.

<P>Variables are specified using using the equal sign (<CODE>=</CODE>)
on the command-line or in the list file (<CODE>$name=value</CODE>);
there is no limit on the number of variables you can specify:

<UL><PRE>
epm mandir=/foo/bar/man epm epm.list
</PRE></UL>

<P>EPM can also produce vendor-specific distributions using the
<CODE>-f</CODE> option:

<UL><PRE>
epm -f format ...
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>format</I> option can be one of:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>depot</CODE> or <CODE>swinstall</CODE> - HP-UX software
	distribution.

	<LI><CODE>dpkg</CODE> - Debian software distribution.

	<LI><CODE>inst</CODE> or <CODE>tardist</CODE> - IRIX software
	distribution.

	<LI><CODE>native</CODE> - "Native" software distribution (RPM,
	INST, DEPOT, PKG, etc.) for the platform.

	<LI><CODE>pkg</CODE> - Solaris software distribution.

	<LI><CODE>portable</CODE> - Portable software distribution (default).

	<LI><CODE>rpm</CODE> - RedHat software distribution.

	<LI><CODE>setld</CODE> - Tru64 (setld) software distribution.

</UL>

<P>Everything in the software list file stays the same - you just use the
<CODE>-f</CODE> option to select the format.  For example, to build an RPM
distribution of EPM, type:

<UL><PRE>
epm -f rpm epm
</PRE></UL>

<P>The result will be an RPM distribution file instead of the portable
distribution file.
