       The  EPM  sseettuupp  program normally presents the user with a
       list of software products to install, which  is  called  a
       "custom" software installation.

       If  a  file  called  _s_e_t_u_p_._t_y_p_e_s is present in the package
       directory, the user will instead be presented with a  list
       of  installation types.  Each type has an associated prod-
       uct list which determines the products that are  installed
       by  default. If a type has no products associated with it,
       then it is treated as a custom installation and  the  user
       is presented with a list of packages to choose from.

       The  _s_e_t_u_p_._t_y_p_e_s  file is an ASCII text file consisting of
       type and product lines. Comments can be inserted by start-
       ing a line with the pound sign (#). Each installation type
       is defined by a line starting with the word TYPE. Products
       are defined by a line starting with the word INSTALL:

     TYPE Typical End-User Configuration
     INSTALL foo
     INSTALL foo-help
     TYPE Typical Developer Configuration
     INSTALL foo
     INSTALL foo-help
     INSTALL foo-devel
     INSTALL foo-examples
     TYPE Custom Configuration

       In   the  example  above,  three  installation  types  are
       defined. Since the last type  includes  no  products,  the
       user  will  be presented with the full list of products to
       choose from.
