     mmmmkkkkeeeeppppmmmmlllliiiisssstttt recursively generates file list entries for files,
     links,  and  directories. The file list is send to the stan-
     dard output.

     The -_g option overrides the group ownership of the files  in
     the specified directories with the specified group name.

     The -_u option overrides the user ownership of the  files  in
     the specified directories with the specified user name.

     The --_p_r_e_f_i_x option adds the specified directory to the des-
     tination  path.  For  example,  if  you  installed  files to
     /opt/foo and wanted to build a distribution  that  installed
     the  files  in  /usr/local, the following command would gen-
     erate a file list that is installed in /usr/local:

          mkepmlist --prefix=/usr/local /opt/foo >foo.list
