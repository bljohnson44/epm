       eeppmm  generates  software  packages complete with installa-
       tion, removal, and (if necessary)  patch  scripts.  Unless
       otherwise  specified,  the  files required for _p_r_o_d_u_c_t are
       read from a file named "_p_r_o_d_u_c_t.list".

       Executable files in the distribution are normally stripped
       of  debugging  information  when packaged. To disable this
       functionality use the _-_g option.

       The _-_t _o_p_t_i_o_n _(_"_t_e_s_t_"_) _d_i_s_a_b_l_e_s  _t_h_e  _g_e_n_e_r_a_t_i_o_n  _o_f  _c_o_m_-

       Distribution archives normally are named "product-version-
       system-release-machine.tar.gz"    and    "product-version-
       system-release-machine-patch.tar.gz"  (for patch distribu-
       tions.)  The "system-release-machine" information  can  be
       customized  or  eliminated  using  the  _-_n option with the
       appropriate trailing letters.  Using  _-_n  by  itself  will
       remove  the "system-release-machine" string from the file-
       name entirely.

            named product.

       %install _s_c_r_i_p_t _o_r _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
            Specifies  a  script  or  program to be run after all
            files are installed.

       %license _l_i_c_e_n_s_e _f_i_l_e
            Specifies  the  file  to  display  as  the   software
