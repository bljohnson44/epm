       eeppmm generates software packages  complete  with  installa-
       tion,  removal,  and  (if necessary) patch scripts. Unless
       otherwise specified, the files required  for  _p_r_o_d_u_c_t  are
       read from a file named "_p_r_o_d_u_c_t.list".

       The  _-_f  option ("format") specifies the distribution for-
       mat:

       deb
            Generate a Debian distribution suitable for installa-
            tion on a Debian Linux system.

       inst, tardist
            Generate  an IRIX distribution suitable for installa-
            tion on an system running IRIX.

       pkg
            Generate an AT&T software  package.  These  are  used
            primarily under Solaris.

       portable
            Generate  a  portable  distribution  based  on  shell
            scripts and tar files.  The resulting distribution is
            installed  and  removed the same way on all operating
            systems. [default]

       rpm
            Generate a Red Hat Package Manager ("RPM")  distribu-
            tion  suitable  for  installation  on a Red Hat Linux
            system.

       swinstall, depot
            Generate a HP-UX software distribution.

       Executable files in the distribution are normally stripped
       of  debugging  information  when packaged. To disable this
       functionality use the _-_g option.

       The _-_s option ("setup") includes the ESP  Software  Wizard
       with  the  specified XPM image file with the distribution.
       This option is currently only available for portable  dis-
       tributions.

       The _-_v option ("verbose") increases the amount of informa-
       tion that is reported. Use multiple v's for  more  verbose
       output.

       Distributions  normally are named "product-version-system-
       release-machine.ext" and  "product-version-system-release-
       machine-patch.ext" (for patch distributions.) The "system-
       release-machine" information can be customized  or  elimi-
       nated  using  the  _-_n option with the appropriate trailing
       letters. Using _-_n  by  itself  will  remove  the  "system-
       release-machine" string from the filename entirely.

       Debian,  IRIX, portable, and Red Hat distributions use the
       extensions  ".deb",  ".tardist",  "tar.gz",   and   ".rpm"
       respectively.
