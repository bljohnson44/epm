       eeppmm generates software packages  complete  with  installa-
       tion,  removal,  and  (if necessary) patch scripts. Unless
       otherwise specified, the files required  for  _p_r_o_d_u_c_t  are
       read from a file named "_p_r_o_d_u_c_t.list".

       Executable files in the distribution are normally stripped
       of debugging information when packaged.  To  disable  this
       functionality use the _-_g option.

       ("%") as follows:
